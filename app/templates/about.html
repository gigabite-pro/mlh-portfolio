                    Hi! I'm Vaibhav Sharma (he/him), a third-year student
                    majoring in Statistics at The University of British
                    Columbia, Vancouver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating
                    beautiful and functional websites. I have experience in both
                    front-end and back-end development, and I'm always looking
                    to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I love
                    working on projects that challenge me and allow me to be
                    creative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love creating cool projects and participating in
                    hackathons. In my 4 year journey, I have participated in
                    more than 20 hackathons and have won a bunch of them. I have
                    also been a mentor at various hackathons and have helped
                    students build their projects. Recently, I participated in
                    Hack the North 2023, the biggest hackathon in Canada, and
                    won the Best Use of MongoDB prize.
